Hi {first_name},

Pleasure to meet you! My name is [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuarcher/) and I'm the founder of [arketa](http://arketa.co), a seed-stage company backed by First Round Capital and Y Combinator.

We're a small but mighty team of 15 focused on improving the experience of operating a fitness/wellness business in the post-pandemic world. Both my co-founder, [Rachel Lea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelleafishman/), and I are really excited about the early traction we've seen in customer retention and have a sales team led by industry experts like [Gregg Alexander](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregg-alexander-5959a74/).

We're looking to hire a Backend Engineering Lead ([*linked here*](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/arketa/jobs/uFQJCCMK7-software-engineer-backend)) with strong serverless architecture experience to advance our modern web app, work collaboratively with our product team, and build the foundations of our engineering team. We're looking for someone who's motivated by making a difference in the world, takes pride in clean code and loves mentoring others. I thought you'd be a great fit based on your background leading a team at ChowNow.

Are you free this week for a quick call? Let me know what your schedule looks like and we'll get something on the calendar!

Best,
Josh
